# Overview
This exercise officially introduces the `foreach` loop and requires the programmer to refactor the W01.2.1T11 exercise code to use a foreach loop.

Too bad that I already kinda did that and I've been using foreach loops for a long time already. So yeah, this took no effort. Nothing else to be said.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List<double> grades = [7, 5.5, 3.2, 10, 4.5];
        int studentsPassed = 0;
        foreach (double grade in grades)
        {
            switch (grade >= 5.5)
            {
                case true:
                    studentsPassed++;
                    break;
            }
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"{studentsPassed} out of {grades.Count} students passed");
    }
}
```
