# Overview
This exercise introduces methods that `return` a value.
It requires the programmer to make a `Pow2(int)` method to return the squared number of a given integer.

This exercise also used a unit test file, but I was unable to make that work in my VSCode environment. 
Considering I didn't change anything in that file, I'll leave that out of the code for now.
Once I figure out how to actually make it work, I'll include it in the same directory.

# Code
```cs
public static class Program
{
    public static int Pow2(int value) => value * value;
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Pow2(5));
    }
}
```
