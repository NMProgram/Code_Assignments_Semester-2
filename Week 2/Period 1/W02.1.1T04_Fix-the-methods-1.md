# Overview
This exercise requires the programmer to fix a few of the methods given in the template to prevent compile errors from popping up.

Very easy to do. Only requires the knowledge of ternary operators and return data types.

# Code
## Old Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int maxHP = 10;
        int currHP = 5;

        currHP = DrinkPotion(currHP, maxHP);
        DisplayStatus(currHP);

        currHP = TakeDamage(currHP, 15);
        DisplayStatus(currHP);
    }

    public static string DisplayStatus(int currHP)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Current HP: {currHP}{(currHP <= 0 ? " (Dead)" : "")}");
    }

    public static void DrinkPotion(int currHP, int maxHP) => Minimum(currHP + 10, maxHP);
    public static void TakeDamage(int currHP, int damage) => Maximum(currHP - damage, 0);

    public static bool Minimum(int n1, int n2) => n1 < n2 ? n1 : n2;
    public static bool Maximum(int n1, int n2) => n1 > n2 ? n1 : n2;
}

```
## New Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int maxHP = 10;
        int currHP = 5;

        currHP = DrinkPotion(currHP, maxHP);
        DisplayStatus(currHP);

        currHP = TakeDamage(currHP, 15);
        DisplayStatus(currHP);
    }

    public static void DisplayStatus(int currHP)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Current HP: {currHP}{(currHP <= 0 ? " (Dead)" : "")}");
    }

    public static int DrinkPotion(int currHP, int maxHP) => Minimum(currHP + 10, maxHP);
    public static int TakeDamage(int currHP, int damage) => Maximum(currHP - damage, 0);

    public static int Minimum(int n1, int n2) => (n1 < n2) ? n1 : n2;
    public static int Maximum(int n1, int n2) => (n1 > n2) ? n1 : n2;
}

```
