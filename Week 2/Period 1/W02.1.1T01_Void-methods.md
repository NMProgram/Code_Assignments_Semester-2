# Overview
This exercise introduces the usage of `void` methods, methods that don't return anything.
It requires the programmer to make a void method PrintFullName, that prints the first and last name with a space inbetween.

Considering I've already practiced a little with this, this was extremely easy. 
I did learn that `public` is required to make it accessible outside the class, though.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    public static void PrintFullName(string firstName, string lastName)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{firstName} {lastName}");
    }
    static void Main()
    {
        PrintFullName("John", "Doe");
    }
}
```
