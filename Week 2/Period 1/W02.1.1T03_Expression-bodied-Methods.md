# Overview
This exercise introduces `expression-bodied` methods, methods using `=>` to immediately return a value or commit an action.
It requires the programmer to make two methods, one `void` and one `string`,
that print out the full name of a person.

Only the methods were coded by me, the rest was provided as a template by CodeGrade.

I forgot to copy the template at first, so I had to paste the code I already had inside of another class, 
but it was very easy to do this one as well.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string fName = PromptForInput("What is your first name?");
        string lName = PromptForInput("What is your last name?");

        Console.WriteLine(GetFullName(fName, lName));
        DisplayFullName(fName, lName);
    }

    // Keeps asking if the user doesn't provide an input
    static string PromptForInput(string message)
    {
        string input;
        do
        {
            Console.WriteLine(message);
            input = Console.ReadLine()!;
        } while (string.IsNullOrEmpty(input));

        return input;
    }

    public static string GetFullName(string firstName, string lastName) => $"{firstName} {lastName}";
    public static void DisplayFullName(string firstName, string lastName) => 
    Console.WriteLine($"{firstName} {lastName}");
}
```
