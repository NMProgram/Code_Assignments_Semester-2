# Intro
In this repository, all of my answers to the code assignments found in CodeGrade for Semester 2 of Computer Science are placed as preservation. These all include code using C# as its programming language and follow OODP. In this README file, you can view my analysis of what I've learned during this semester.

# Overview
All CodeGrade assignments are ordered in a specific format. The basic format is W{week_num}.{Period}.{1: T, 2: O}{Assignment Total}, so for the first (simple) exercise you would have `W01.1.1T01` and for a more advanced assignment `W01.1.2O01`. Each week has two periods of new information being fed to the students, meaning that they cover a new topic twice a week.
