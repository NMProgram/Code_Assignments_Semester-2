# Overview
This was the first official exercise of semester 2, requiring the programmer to print out the last name and initial character of the user through user input,
and display that information on the console using `Console.WriteLine()`. The input had to be done with `Console.ReadLine()`.
This code does bring up two warnings relating to null values, but I'm sure I'll learn how to get rid of those eventually down the line.
# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    /* 
    'static void Main': your program starts here.
    The Python equivalnt is:
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
    */

    static void Main()
    {
        // Read Last Name
        Console.WriteLine("Hello. Please enter your last name.");
        string lastName = Console.ReadLine();
        // Read Initial Char
        Console.WriteLine("What is the initial of your first name?");
        char init = Convert.ToChar(Console.ReadLine());
        // Print Ending Message
        Console.WriteLine($"Welcome to the course, {init} {lastName}. We will watch your career with great interest.");
    }
}
```
