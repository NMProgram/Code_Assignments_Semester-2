# Overview
This first assignment requires the programmer to ask for a certain amount of seconds (as an integer) 
and to convert that amount into the total amount of hours, minutes and the seconds that remain.
I got stuck on this for a few minutes, but I soon figured out that you could just subtract from seconds and easily get the remaining seconds.
In hindsight, though, they probably expected you to use the modulo `%` operation here, but this was way easier to do.

# Code
```cs
bool result = int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out int secs);
if (result)
{
    int hours = secs / 3600; secs -= 3600 * hours;
    int minutes = secs / 60; secs -= 60 * minutes;
    Console.WriteLine($"Hours: {hours}\nMinutes: {minutes}\nSeconds left: {secs}");   
}
```
