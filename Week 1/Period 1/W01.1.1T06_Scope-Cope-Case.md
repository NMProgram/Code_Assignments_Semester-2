# Overview
This exercise required the programmer to take a given code sample from CodeGrade and fix the scope issue relating to the new text to print.
It used letters as input to determine whether or not a string had to be uppercase, lowercase or the same, which was also a thing that needed to be fixed in the program.
As usual, I made this more complicated than necessary and made it a function instead of just making `newText` or global variable in `Main()`, but it works so it's fine.
And yes, there are still warnings being displayed in this batch of code because CodeGrade is too incompetent to fix that themselves.
And I'm too lazy to fix all of it.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static string IfStatement(string choice, string text)
    {
        if (choice.Equals("U"))
        {
            return text.ToUpper();
        }
        else if (choice.Equals("L"))
        {
            return text.ToLower();
        }
        else
        {
            return text;
        }
    }
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Give some text");
        string text = Console.ReadLine();
        Console.WriteLine("What do you want to do with this text?");
        Console.WriteLine("U: make all uppercase");
        Console.WriteLine("L: make all lowercase");
        Console.WriteLine("Any other key: do not change");
        string choice = Console.ReadLine().ToUpper();
        if (text is not null && choice is not null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(IfStatement(choice, text));
        }
        // Error
        // Console.WriteLine(newText);
    }
}
```
