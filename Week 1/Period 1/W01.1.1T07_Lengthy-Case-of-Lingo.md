# Overview
This exercise required the programmer to display a six-letter word (Length) with only the first and last two letters being shown, the rest filled in with `..`.
The user would be able to give an input and receive a hint on what they were wrong on (i.e. wrong case, wrong letters).
Again, I like to put the `if-statements` in separate methods for code clarity, so that's what I did here. Pretty simple exercise.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void IfStatement(string input, string word, int length)
    {
        if (input == word)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Correct!");
        }
        else if (input.ToLower() == word.ToLower())
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Kind of correct; the case was just wrong");
        }
        else
        {
            string message = input.Length != length ? " That is not even a six-letter word!" : "";
            Console.WriteLine("Incorrect!" + message);
        }
    }
    static void Main()
    {
        string word = "Length";
        int length = word.Length;
        Console.WriteLine("You have one chance to guess this six-letter word:");
        Console.WriteLine($"{word[0..2]}..{word[(length - 2)..]}");
        string input = Console.ReadLine() ?? "Empty";
        IfStatement(input, word, length);
    }
}
```
