# Overview
This exercise required the programmer to copy given `Python` code and translate it into `C#`. The goal was to ask an integer from the user
and use that integer to print out information relating to the user's age, as a string. 
The main new things introduced here were `string` to `int` conversions and `int` to `double` conversion. Math operations were also introduced.

# Code
## Python Code to copy
```python
age = int(input("What is your age? "))
print("You are " + str(age) + ". That's old enough to program!")

print("Last year you were " + str(age-1))
print("Next year you will be " + str(age+1))
print("At double your age you will be " + str(age*2))
print("Next year, double your age will be " + str((age+1) * 2))

print("Half your age is " + str(age / 2.0)) #This should be a double in C#
print("Half your age (rounded down) is " + str(int(age / 2)))
print("The last digit of your age is " + str(age % 10))
```
## Used C# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("What is your age?");
        int age = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
        Console.WriteLine("You are " + age + ". That's old enough to program!");

        Console.WriteLine("Last year you were " + (age - 1));
        Console.WriteLine("Next year you will be " + (age + 1));
        Console.WriteLine("At double your age you will be " + (age * 2));
        Console.WriteLine("Next year, double your age will be " + ((age + 1) * 2));

        Console.WriteLine("Half your age is " + Convert.ToDouble(age / 2.0));
        Console.WriteLine("Half your age (rounded down) is " + (age / 2));
        Console.WriteLine("The last digit of your age is " + (age % 10));
    }
}
```
