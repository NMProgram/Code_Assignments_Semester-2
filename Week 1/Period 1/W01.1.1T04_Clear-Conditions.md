# Overview
This exercise required the programmer to get the ages of two users through user input 
and return whether the first user had the same age, was younger or was older than the other user as a print using `Console.ReadLine()`.
It introduced the usage of `if-else if-else` statements and ternary operators: `(expr1 > expr2) ? true : false`

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("What is your age?");
        int age = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
        Console.WriteLine("What is the age of the student next to you?");
        int otherAge = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
        if (age == otherAge)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Your ages are equal");
        }
        else
        {
            string message = (age > otherAge) ? "You are older" : "You are younger";
            Console.WriteLine(message);
        }
    }
}
```
