# Overview
This exercise required the programmer to make use of `switch expressions` to group an age to a specific string relating to that age.
Ages 0 - 12 would be a child, 13 - 19 would be a teenager, 20 - 150 is an adult and anything else is considered invalid.
It took a while to find how to do switch expressions with ranges, but I eventually found the answer on w3tutorials.net of all places.
Other than that, this was very simple.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static string Switch(int age)
    {
        string ageClass = age switch
        {
            >= 0 and <= 12 => "a child",
            >= 13 and <= 19 => "a teenager",
            >= 20 and <= 150 => "an adult",
            _ => "invalid",
        };
        return ageClass;
    }
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Enter an age:");
        int age = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

        // Your switch expression (NOT a regular switch) goes here
        string ageClass = Switch(age);
        Console.WriteLine($"Age {age}: {ageClass}");
    }
}
```
