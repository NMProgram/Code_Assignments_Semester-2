# Overview
This exercise required the programmer to fix the syntax errors and logical errors in a given template of code.
It relates to calculating the discount price of a product using double (or decimal) values.
I used decimal here, purely because I know they're more precise for financial calculations. Very easy exercise.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        decimal discount = 0.1M;
        int price = 55;
        decimal discountPrice = price * (1 - discount);

        var message = $"The discount price is {discountPrice}";
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
}
```
