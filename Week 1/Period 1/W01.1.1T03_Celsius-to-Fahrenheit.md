# Overview
This exercise required the programmer to get the total amount of degrees Celsius from the user as user input
and convert this amount to Fahrenheit and printing this amount afterwards.
I was supposed to use `Convert.ToDouble()` or `double.Parse()`, but using interpolated strings seemed to already do the trick, so whatever.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("What is the temperature in Celsius?");
        int celsius = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
        double fahrenheit = celsius * 1.8 + 32;
        Console.WriteLine($"{celsius} C = {fahrenheit} F");
        Console.WriteLine($"Truncated that is {(int) fahrenheit} F");
    }
}
```
