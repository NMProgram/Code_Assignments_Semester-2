# Overview
This exercise introduces the usage of the `Random` Class and the initialization of class instances in `C#`.
It requires the programmer to print out 10 randomly generated numbers between 1 and 6 (a six-sided die).
Once I learned that you can use `new Random()` to generate an instance of the class Random, this was very easy to do.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Random random = new Random();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(random.Next(1, 7));
        }
    }
}
```
