# Overview
This exercise requires the programmer to ask for a size to generate a black-and-white game board with (like in chess).
Then, a nested `for` loop prints out the first letter of the color of that tile on the game board, with an equal row and column size.

The only reason this one took me a while was because I at first misunderstood the goal (as usual)
and then I wanted to try and make the code as short as possible, as I pretty much used two `if-else` statements 
that could theoretically have been made into a ternary operator.
But I eventually decided to go with the `if-else` statements instead for convenience.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int size;
        do 
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Enter the size of the board:");
            size = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()!);
        }
        while (size < 2);
        for (int i = 1; i <= size; i++)
        {
            string pattern = "";
            for (int j = 1; j <= size; j++)
            {
                if (size % 2 == 0)
                {
                    if (i % 2 == 0) {pattern += (j % 2 == 0) ? "W" : "B";}
                    else {pattern += (j % 2 == 0) ? "B" : "W";}
                }
                else
                {
                    if (i % 2 == 0) {pattern += (j % 2 == 0) ? "B" : "W";}
                    else {pattern += (j % 2 == 0) ? "W" : "B";}
                }
            }
            Console.WriteLine(pattern);
        }
    }
}
```
