# Overview
Part 2 of this exercise is pretty much the same thing, except now using a fixed seed to generate pseudorandom integers between 1 and 6.
This was even easier than the last one, but I guess that's to be expected.

# Code
```cs
Random random = new Random(1);
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(random.Next(1, 7));
}
```
