# Overview
This exercise requires the programmer to ask for two options (`int`), with one of them decrementing the user's total money count.
When the money count reaches 0, a different message is printed to indicate the end. The usage of `while` loops were introduced here.
As to be expected, this was extremely easy, requiring only a little bit of knowledge surrounding the syntax of a `while` loop.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int money = 4;
        while (money != 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Money left: {money}");
            Console.WriteLine("Look around (1) or go in a ride (2)?");
            bool optionRes = int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out int option);
            switch (option)
            {
                case 1:
                    Console.WriteLine("Yay!");
                    break;
                case 2:
                    money--;
                    Console.WriteLine("Wheee!");
                    break;
            }
        }
        Console.WriteLine("Time to go home");
    }
}
```
