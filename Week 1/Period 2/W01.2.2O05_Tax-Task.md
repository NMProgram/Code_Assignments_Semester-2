# Overview
This exercise requires the programmer to calculate the total taxes that need to be paid with a given balance, interest rate and within a certain amount of years.
Then, the total taxes paid and the current balance get printed out at the end.

Only the `switch` statement was coded by me, the rest was provided as a template by CodeGrade.

This admittedly took me longer than it should've, but I've always struggled with calculating taxes in Economics, so yeah. 
I just misunderstood what to do, so this took a while to figure out.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        double taxesPaid = 0;
        Console.WriteLine("What is the initial balance in whole Euros?");
        double balance = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
        Console.WriteLine("What is the interest rate in percent?");
        double interestPct = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
        Console.WriteLine("Calculate over how many years?");
        int years = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

        // Your tax code goes here
        for (int i = 0; i < years; i++)
        {
            balance *= 1 + (interestPct / 100);
            switch (balance)
            {
                case > 50000 and <= 100000:
                    taxesPaid += (balance - 50000) * 0.015;
                    balance -= (balance - 50000) * 0.015;
                    break;
                case > 100000:
                    taxesPaid += 50000 * 0.015;
                    taxesPaid += (balance - 100000) * 0.03;
                    balance -= (50000 * 0.015) + ((balance - 100000) * 0.03);
                    break;
            }
        }
        balance = (int)balance;
        taxesPaid = (int)(taxesPaid);
        Console.WriteLine($"Balance after {years} years: {balance}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Amount of taxes paid: {taxesPaid}");
    }
}
```
