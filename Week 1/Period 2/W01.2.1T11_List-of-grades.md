# Overview
This exercise introduces the creation of a `List` object.
It requires the programmer to create a list of grades and print out how many of those are above or equal to a 5.5 (passed).
To make it a bit more interesting, I decided to use a `foreach` loop here to practice. 
Turns out that it's not very different from what I'm used to, so that's good.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List<double> grades = [7, 5.5, 3.2, 10, 4.5];
        int studentsPassed = 0;
        foreach (double grade in grades)
        {
            switch (grade >= 5.5)
            {
                case true:
                    studentsPassed++;
                    break;
            }
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"_{studentsPassed} out of {grades.Count} students passed_");
    }
}
```
