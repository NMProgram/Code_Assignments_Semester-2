# Overview
This exercise introduces the usage of `do... while` loops (a concept I've already seen in `Lua` in the form of a `repeat` loop), 
by requiring the programmer to repeatedly ask the user to delete a file by entering "y", or to not delete it by entering "n". All other inputs are ignored.
Everything in the code (except the `do... while` loop) were given as a template.
The hardest part here was that I made the mistake of using a `Contains()` method, when `Equals()` is clearly the method you're supposed to use here.

No one said I was the smartest person, alright?

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List<string> fileList = [
            "OODP assignment.docx",
            "Project Presentation.pptx",
            "TODO list.xlsx",
        ];

        string whichFileToDelete = fileList[0];

        Console.WriteLine("File selected to delete: " + whichFileToDelete);
        string confirm;

        do
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Really delete this file? (y/n)");
            confirm = Console.ReadLine() ?? "";
        }
        while (!confirm.Equals("y") && !confirm.Equals("n"));

        if (confirm == "y")
        {
            fileList.Remove(whichFileToDelete);
            Console.WriteLine("File deleted");
        }
    }
}
```
