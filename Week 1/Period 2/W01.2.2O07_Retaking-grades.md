# Overview
This exercise requires the programmer to create a `List` object of grades 
and to ask the user for each grade below a `5,5` whether they'd like to retake the course.
If so, the grade gets incremented by 1 in the list.
At the end, the full list gets printed.

I, again, misread what I was supposed to do and ended up not realizing that you had to validate the Y/N input 
and continually ask the user for a correct answer.
That's pretty much the only thing that made this take a while. 
That and I was trying to make use of the same list when you could literally just make a new one.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List<decimal> grades = [6.5M, 9.5M, 4M, 5M, 4.5M, 10M, 7.1M];
        List<decimal> newGrades = [];
        foreach (decimal grade in grades)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Grade: {grade}");
            if (grade < 5.5M)
            {
                string answer;
                do
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Retake this course?");
                    answer = Console.ReadLine()!.ToLower();
                }
                while (!answer.Equals("y") && !answer.Equals("n"));
                if (answer.Equals("y")) {newGrades.Add(grade + 1);}
                else {newGrades.Add(grade);}
            }
            else {newGrades.Add(grade);}
        }
        Console.WriteLine("Final grades:");
        foreach (decimal grade in newGrades) {Console.WriteLine(grade);}
    }
}
```
