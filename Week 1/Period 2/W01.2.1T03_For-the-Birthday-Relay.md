# Overview
This exercise introduces the usage of `for` loops by requiring the programmer to print a Happy Birthday message for a name entered by the user.
At first, I only did the first message twice inside of the for loop and the rest outside of it,
but then I realized you could just use a switch statement to put it all inside of the for loop. So that's what I did.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string msg = "Happy birthday to you!";
        Console.WriteLine("What is the person's name?");
        string name = Console.ReadLine() ?? "";
        string nameMsg = $"Happy birthday dear {name}!";
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
        {
            switch (i)
            {
                case 2:
                    Console.WriteLine(nameMsg);
                    break;
                default:
                    Console.WriteLine(msg);
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
