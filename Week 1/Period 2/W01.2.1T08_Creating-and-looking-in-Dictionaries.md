# Overview
This exercise introduces the creation of `Dictionary<key, value>` objects and looking up values within that Dictionary.
It requires the programmer to create a Dictionary<string, decimal> object with grocery store items. 
The user then enters one of these items to see what the price is of it.
Only the creation, the if-condition and the lookup of the value was added by me, the rest was just a template.
Definitely easy to do once you know how it works.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Dictionary<string, decimal> groceryPrices = new()
        {
            {"Milk", 1.49M},
            {"Bread", 0.99M},
            {"Eggs", 2.99M},
            {"Butter", 3.49M},
        };
        Console.WriteLine("Available products:");
        foreach (string product in groceryPrices.Keys)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($" - {product}");
        }

        Console.Write("\nEnter the name of the product to view its price: ");
        string item = Console.ReadLine()!;

        if (groceryPrices.ContainsKey(item)) // If the given product is in the keys of the dictionary...
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"The price of {item} is {groceryPrices[item]}"); // ... print its price
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Item not found");
        }
    }
}
```
