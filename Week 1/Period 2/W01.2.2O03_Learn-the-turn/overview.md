# Overview
This exercise requires the programmer to fix the scope issue presented in the template provided by CodeGrade,
where an `int` value is put inside of a `for` loop and cannot be printed outside of that scope. 

This literally took 2 seconds to fix. Why is this an objective exercise?

# Code
