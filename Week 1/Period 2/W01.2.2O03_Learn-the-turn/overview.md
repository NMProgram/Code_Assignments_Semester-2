# Overview
This exercise requires the programmer to fix the scope issue presented in the template provided by CodeGrade,
where an `int` value is put inside of a `for` loop and cannot be printed outside of that scope. 
The point is to see how many turns it took the user to defeat the enemy, using a `Fighter` class provided in `fighter.cs`.

This literally took 2 seconds to fix. Why is this an objective exercise?

# Code
See fighter.cs and program.cs in this directory for used code.
