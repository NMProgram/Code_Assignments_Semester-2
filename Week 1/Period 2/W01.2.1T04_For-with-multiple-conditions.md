# Overview
This exercise introduces another way to use `for` loops, by putting in a variable instead of an iterator `i`.
It requires the programmer to ask the pin of the user. 
An error message is printed when the max attempts have been exhausted and the program prints "Correct!" and exits when correctly guessed.
It took a bit to figure out how to make a variable be part of the `for` loop, but it was very easy to do all things considered.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int maxAttempts = 3;
        string pin = "1234";
        for (; maxAttempts != 0; maxAttempts--)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Enter your PIN");
            Console.WriteLine($"{maxAttempts} attempts left");
            string input = Console.ReadLine() ?? "";
            if (input.Equals(pin))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Correct!");
                Environment.Exit(0);
            }
        }
        Console.WriteLine("Your pass is confiscated.");
    }
}
```
