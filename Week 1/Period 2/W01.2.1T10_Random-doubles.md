# Overview
This exercise introduces the usage of the `NextDouble()` method part of the `Random` Class.
It requires the programmer to set up a loop for attacking a boss with a base Attack Power that occasionally doubles with a Critical Hit.
Only the code in the while loop was coded by me, the rest was provided as a template.
It took a bit to figure out how to do the chance calculation, but it was very easy in hindsight.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Random random = new Random(1);
        int attack = 50;
        double critChance = 0.33;

        int bossHP = 500;

        while (bossHP > 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Boss HP: {bossHP}");
            switch (random.NextDouble() < critChance)
            {
                case true:
                    bossHP -= attack * 2;
                    Console.WriteLine($"Damage: {attack * 2}");
                    break;
                case false:
                    bossHP -= attack;
                    Console.WriteLine($"Damage: {attack}");
                    break;
            }
            Console.ReadLine();
        }

        Console.WriteLine("Boss defeated");
    }
}
```
