# Overview
This exercise introduces the `Dictionary` type and the (`Add()`, `TryAdd()`) methods, alongside assigning a new value to a key.
It requires the programmer to add a fruit entered by the user to a given dictionary as a new entry if it's not in the dictionary 
and otherwise increment the total of that entered fruit.
The only code I had to make was the switch statement I used, so this wasn't very difficult to do.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Dictionary<string, int> fruitBasket = new() {
            { "Apple", 3 },
            { "Orange", 2 },
            { "Pear", 4 },
        };

        Console.Write("Add what fruit? ");
        string fruitToAdd = Console.ReadLine()!;

        switch (fruitBasket.ContainsKey(fruitToAdd))
        {
            case false:
                fruitBasket.TryAdd(fruitToAdd, 1);
                break;
            case true:
                fruitBasket[fruitToAdd]++;
                break;
        }

        Console.WriteLine("\nFruit count:");
        foreach (string fruit in fruitBasket.Keys)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($" - {fruit}: {fruitBasket[fruit]}");
        }
    }
}
```
