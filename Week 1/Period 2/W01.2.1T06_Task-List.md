# Overview
This exercise introduces some `List` methods that can be used (`Add`, `Remove`, `Count`).
It requires the programmer to list the total amount of tasks at a certain point in time and to print all elements within the List.
You had to use a loop for this exercise, but I thought that meant over the whole process, 
so I ended up iterating over the list and creating an iteration integer for the whole process,
accidentally creating a nested for loop already. Whoops.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List<string> tasks = [];
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            switch (i)
            {
                case 0:
                case 2:
                case 4:
                    Console.WriteLine($"Amount of tasks: {tasks.Count}");
                    for (int j = 0; j < tasks.Count; j++)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine(tasks[j]);
                    }
                    break;
                case 1:
                    tasks.Add("Mow lawn");
                    tasks.Add("Pay taxes");
                    break;
                case 3:
                    tasks.Remove("Mow lawn");
                    tasks.Add("Shopping");
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
