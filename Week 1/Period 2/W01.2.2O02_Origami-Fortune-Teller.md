# Overview
This exercise requires the programmer to ask for a color (red, blue, yellow, green) and a number (1-8 inclusive) from the user.
A fortune number gets calculated by taking the number and adding the length of the chosen color string,
taking the modulus of 4 and adding 1 to the total. 

Only the `do...while` loops and calculated fortuneNumber are coded by me,
the rest was provided as a template.

This one was very simple to do, and I realized that `do...while` loops are extremely useful for input validation 
and I wish they existed in `Python`.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // V Your code goes below V
        List<string> colorList = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]; 
        string color;
        int number;
        do
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Pick a color (red/blue/green/yellow):");
            color = Console.ReadLine()!;
        }
        while (!colorList.Contains(color.ToLower()));
        do
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Pick a number (1-8)");
            number = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()!);
        }
        while (number < 1 || number > 8);
        int fortuneNumber = (number + color.Length) % 4 + 1;
        // ^ Your code goes above ^
        // No need to look below here for this assignment. But you are welcome to!
        string fortune = GetFortune(fortuneNumber);
        Console.WriteLine(fortune);
    }

    static string GetFortune(int fortuneNumber) => fortuneNumber switch
    {
        1 => "You will be loved and happy!",
        2 => "You will be loved and rich!",
        3 => "You will be loved and famous!",
        4 => "You will be loved, happy, rich, and famous!",
        _ => "Unknown. :( But you will still be loved, no matter what."
    };
}
```
