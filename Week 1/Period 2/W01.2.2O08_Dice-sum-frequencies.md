# Overview
This exercise requires the programmer to make a tally of the outcome of two six-sided dice rolls 500 times 
and print the final results at the end.

This took longer than it should've, because I didn't realize you need to add a space if the value of the sum of the two dices was below 10, 
since that wasn't mentioned in the description of the exercise.
So that was kinda lame.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Dictionary<int, string> tally = new()
        {
            {2, ""},
            {3, ""},
            {4, ""},
            {5, ""},
            {6, ""},
            {7, ""},
            {8, ""},
            {9, ""},
            {10, ""},
            {11, ""},
            {12, ""},
        };
        Random rand = new(0);
        int howManyTimes = 500;
        int dieSides = 6;

        // Your code goes here
        for (int i = 0; i < howManyTimes; i++)
        {
            int rng = rand.Next(1, dieSides + 1) + rand.Next(1, dieSides + 1);
            tally[rng] = tally[rng] + "|";
        }
        foreach (KeyValuePair<int, string> pair in tally) 
        {
            if (pair.Key < 10) {Console.WriteLine($" {pair.Key}: {pair.Value}");}
            else {Console.WriteLine($"{pair.Key}: {pair.Value}");}
        }
    }
}
```
