# Overview
This exercise required the programmer to substitute the client name, date of appointment, time of appointment and the company name
into an email template and print it.

Only the template string was altered by me, the rest was provided as a template by CodeGrade.

I know they wanted me to use dictionaries here, but I think they forgot that interpolating strings exists. 
So yeah, I did this within less than a minute. Probably the easiest one yet.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.Write("What is the client's name? ");
        string clientName = Console.ReadLine()!;
        Console.Write("What is date of the appointment? ");
        string date = Console.ReadLine()!;
        Console.Write("What is the time of the appointment? ");
        string time = Console.ReadLine()!;
        Console.Write("What is the company's name? ");
        string companyName = Console.ReadLine()!;

        string template = $"Dear {clientName},\n\nThank you for booking an appointment on {date}.\nWe look forward to seeing you at {time}.\n\nBest regards,\n{companyName}";
        Console.WriteLine(template);
    }
}
```
