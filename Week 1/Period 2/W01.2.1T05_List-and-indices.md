# Overview
This exercise introduces the syntax of creating a `List` object and the concept of indexing with List objects.
It requires the programmer to print out the last element of a given list in the template.
At first, I wanted to use the `Last()` method because VSCode told me indexing could have been simplified, 
but CodeGrade wanted you to specifically use indexing. Go figure.

# Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List<string> pack = ["laptop", "lunch", "notebook", "pen"];

        Console.WriteLine($"The first item in the pack is a {pack[0]}");
        Console.WriteLine($"The last item in the pack is a {pack[pack.Count - 1]}");
    }
}

```
