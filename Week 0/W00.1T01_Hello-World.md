# Overview
This was the introduction of C# given to us during the last few weeks of BaseCamp (semester 1, using Python). 
The goal of this exercise was to understand the core basics of C# before this new semester started, so that we would be prepared for whatever exercises were coming up later.
The code given here was given by default and I barely changed anything in it, so I don't really know if this counts as "my code".

# Code
```cs
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
using System.Globalization;
using System.Reflection.Metadata;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```
