# Overview
This exercise introduces the concept that `static` methods can only call other `static` methods within the same class.
It requires the programmer to fix a compile-error with the `GetFullName()` method in the `Program` class.

Only the `GetFullName()` method was changed by me, the rest was provided as a template by CodeGrade.

I literally just changed the method to have `static` in front of the name. That's it.

# Code
## Old Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("What is your first name?");
        string? firstName = Console.ReadLine();
        Console.WriteLine("What is your last name?");
        string? lastName = Console.ReadLine();

        string? fullName = GetFullName(firstName, lastName);
        Console.WriteLine(fullName);
    }

    public string? GetFullName(string? fName, string? lName) => $"{fName} {lName}";
}
```
## New Code
```cs
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("What is your first name?");
        string? firstName = Console.ReadLine();
        Console.WriteLine("What is your last name?");
        string? lastName = Console.ReadLine();

        string? fullName = GetFullName(firstName, lastName);
        Console.WriteLine(fullName);
    }

    public static string? GetFullName(string? fName, string? lName) => $"{fName} {lName}";
}
```
